### **Result**

Thus the current series  feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency |610Hz |360Hz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency |470KHz|270KHz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | 489.3KHz |269.6KHz  |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | 12.88| 8.40|
| 5 | Gain at half power point | 9.10 |5.93  |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
